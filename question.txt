Should I treat weapons and their interactions with other weapons, armor, and creatures in a somewhat abstract sense? Or should I consider the interactions of weapons with other weapons, armor, and creatures as scientifically as possible? For example: should the damage a weapon deals be a manually decided number that makes sense for that weapon or should it be scientically calculated according to the physical interaction between the weapon and the creature it is hitting?
